# About

A Fortigate Security Appliance 1Gbps (FSA) is a dedicated single-tenant network device connected upstream from a server that protects any or all servers on a public VLAN. It is purchased separate from a server and can be added to a VLAN at any time.  IBM Cloud deploys the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.fortinet.com/sites/default/files/productdatasheets/FortiGate-300C.pdf){: new_window} within a Virtual Domain (VDOM) on the dedicated appliance, allowing customers full access to that virtual domain without compromising the integrity of the device. 

With the FSA 1Gbps, customers have access to advanced features and the ability to fine tune the device to a much higher degree than other products. The firewall blocks or shapes traffic before the traffic ever reaches the server. The main advantages are that a server only has to handle 'good' traffic and that bandwidth can be constrained for less critical communications. 

Customers can manage the FSA either through the web based FortiOS GUI or the CLI (Command Line Interface) using SSH. High availability can also be ordered, which provides two appliances in active-passive deployment with synchronized configurations.

Since monthly server bandwidth is recorded at the server switch port, traffic blocked by the the FSA 1Gbps is not counted against your monthly allotments, eliminating the need to pay for unwanted traffic.
